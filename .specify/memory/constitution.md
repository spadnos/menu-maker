# Menu Maker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design

- All features must solve real user needs for menu management
- Prioritize intuitive interfaces that require minimal training
- Support multiple menu types (a la carte, prix fixe, dietary-specific)

### II. Data Integrity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- All menu items must have complete nutritional information
- Ingredient lists must be accurate and up-to-date
- Changes to menu items must maintain historical records for reporting

### III. Test-First Development

- All features require automated tests before implementation
- Menu calculations must be verified with test cases
- Edge cases for dietary restrictions must be tested

### IV. Performance & Scalability

- Menu loading must be sub-second even with large catalogs
- Support for multiple locations with different menus
- Efficient search and filtering capabilities

### V. Compliance & Standards

- Adhere to food labeling regulations
- Support for common dietary standards (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- Follow language-specific style guides
- Document public APIs and complex logic
- Regular code reviews with at least one approver

### Testing Requirements

- 80%+ code coverage for all new features
- Integration tests for menu modification workflows
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths

## Governance

### Versioning

- Follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Document breaking changes in release notes
- Maintain backward compatibility within major versions

### Contribution Guidelines

- Feature proposals require use cases and success criteria
- Bug reports must include reproduction steps
- All contributions require passing tests and documentation updates

### Review Process

- All changes require code review
- Security-sensitive changes need additional review
- Performance-impacting changes require benchmarks

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A bistro customer visits the digital menu to browse available dishes. They can view the menu organized by categories (appetizers, entrees, desserts, etc.), search for specific items by name or ingredient, and access detailed recipes for dishes they're interested in. The experience feels elegant and matches the upscale bistro atmosphere.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the menu is loaded, **When** a user views the default page, **Then** menu items are displayed grouped by category sections (e.g., Appetizers, Entrees, Desserts)

2. **Given** a user wants to find a specific dish, **When** they enter "salmon" in the search box, **Then** all menu items containing "salmon" in the name, description, or ingredients are displayed

3. **Given** a user is viewing a menu item, **When** they see the item details, **Then** they can view the name, description, and image (if available)

4. **Given** a menu item has a recipe, **When** a user clicks the recipe link, **Then** they are shown the complete list of ingredients and cooking instructions

5. **Given** a user wants to filter by category, **When** they select "Desserts" from the category filter, **Then** only dessert items are displayed

6. **Given** a user searches by ingredient, **When** they enter "gluten-free" or "dairy", **Then** all items containing that ingredient are shown

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a search returns no results? Display a friendly "No items found" message with suggestion to try different search terms
- What happens when a menu item has no image? Display a placeholder or elegant empty state
- What happens when a recipe link is clicked but no recipe exists? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should items without recipes show a link, or should the link only appear when a recipe exists?]
- How does the menu handle very long item descriptions? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should descriptions be truncated with "read more" or displayed in full?]
- What happens when there are many items in a category? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be pagination, infinite scroll, or show all items?]

# Justification

There are many recipe websites where people publish recipes. This app attempts to add a few features:

1. Allow users to add recipes. Many website are "read-only". You can't add your own recipes.
1. Add recipes in the same place as you can view them. With a Wordpress site,
   you go one place to view recipes and another to add recipes.
1. Allow users to create groups of recipes
1. Allow users to have a single place to collect that recipes that may be from
   multiple sources
1. Scrap a recipe from a website. Many recipe sites have long stories, popups,
   and other things that make it hard to get to (and use) the recipe.

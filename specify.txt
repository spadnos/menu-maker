Build an aplication that can display a an interative menu. The user can search for items by name, ingredients, or category. By default, the menu is divided into sections based on category.
Each menu item has a name, description, and an optional image. In addition, each menu item can have a recipe, which is a list of ingredients and instructions for how to make the item.
The menu items should include a link to the recipe. The styling should be something appropriate for a classy bistro.
